# Procurement Stats
Procurement Stats application. Statistical graphs over Procurement purchase orders.

This application uses Graph application (https://github.com/diliger/Graph) and lets 
you build graphs for a period over purchase orders from Procurement (https://github.com/StarcounterSamples/Procurement) application.

For now it has only one type of report - sold count per product for period.

To see how it works you should create and fill some purchase orders in Procurement application and then add a graph 
for period that includes create dates of the orders.
