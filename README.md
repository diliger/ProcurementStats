# Procurement Stats
Procurement Stats application. Statistical graphs over Procurement purchase orders.

This application lets you manipulate (create, edit, remove) ProcurementGraphs (which inherits Graph class) and fills GraphValues based on purchase orders from Procurement (https://github.com/StarcounterSamples/Procurement) application and period filter.

For now it has only one type of report - sold count per product for period.

To see how it works you should create and fill some purchase orders with Procurement application (or other) and then add a graph 
for period that includes create dates of the orders.
